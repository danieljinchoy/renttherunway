# Rent the Runway


Rent the Runway, launched in 2009, built its business as an online clothing service for special-occasion apparel and accessories based on monthly subscription and membership. Since its success, the company expanded its products to include workwear, children's clothing, and home wear. However, due to Covid-19, America's wardrobe habits has dramatically changed and fewer people need as many work outfits or dress up for events. 

In order to accommodate to this dramatic change, Rent the Runway has started to allow its members to pruchase any item on its site, whether or not they have rented it. Originally, Rent the Runway offered customers the option to purchase the itmes they have rented, but this service is being expanded. The idea is to increase the company's revenue at a time when subscription number is decreasing due to the pandemic. 

This project will look into Rent the Runway's products - a. products that are available for rental and b. products that are available on immediate sale and compare its products lineup to Saks Fifth Avenue and The RealReal. Both Saks Fifth Avenue and the RealReal have luxury brands' products available - Saks Fifth Avenue selling new luxury brand products and The RealReal selling used luxury brand products. The goal is to compare the products to analyze whether Rent the Runway's service/business model is competitive compared to Saks Fifth Avenue service and the RealReal service.





**This project will only focus on women's products.**
